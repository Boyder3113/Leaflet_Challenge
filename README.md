<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Use this interactive map to track earthquake activity in the past week.

The app in this repository pulls the weekly JSON of earthquakes from USGS website and populates a map with circles that mark the location and size of the earthquake. The circle markers contain working tooltips that display the date, time, magnitude, and location of the earthquake; These tooltips appear on click.

To use: pull the files from the respository and host the app locally or via a service like Github pages to see the working map with the last week of earthquake/fault line data.
